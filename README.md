# Gatsby Starter Firebase

## What's included

- `FetchingExample` on how to fetch data from firebase.

  Note: For better experiece you might want to integrate it [redux](https://redux.js.org) or [mobx](http://mobx.js.org).

  If you need it, submit an issue. I can create a starter / example repo with firebase + mobx or redux.
  
  **Update**: I made a another starter [gatsby-starter-redux-firebase](https://github.com/muhajirframe/gatsby-starter-redux-firebase)

- Authentication with [react-firebaseui](https://github.com/firebase/firebaseui-web-react) (`SignIn`, `SignOut`)
